# Elevator-Control-System
This project focuses on a simulation of an elevator control system in Multisim using the PIC16F84A microcontroller, push buttons and a LCD Display. As an added innovation to this, the code defines the number of hours in a day (a new hour is visualized by the blinking of the LCD), and the elevator will wait at the floor where the most probable calls will come from in that hour. The code has been highly optimized to fit the constrained resources of the PIC microcontroller, and with a few modifications to the inital #define of the program, it can be extended to any number of floors and any number of hours.
